## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“ PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python Program to print numbers  range from M to N (including M and N values)


###  Algorithm

1. Begin the program.
2. Use `input()` to read the value of `m` and  `n` from the user.
3. Convert the inputs to integers.
4. Use a `for` loop to iterate from `m` to `n` (inclusive).
5. In each iteration, print the current value of `i`.
6. Terminate the program.

### ðŸ§¾ Program

```
M = int(input())
N = int(input())
for i in range(M,N+1):
    print(i)

```

```
### RESULT
```
Thus, the python program for printing numbers range from `m` to `n` is executed successfully.
